Titanic Survival Prediction Model â€“ Project Overview
Objective:
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not based on historical Titanic data.

Dataset:
The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle Titanic dataset, which includes details of passengers such as:

Passenger Class (Pclass): 1st, 2nd, or 3rd class
Sex: Male or Female
Age: How old the passenger was
SibSp & Parch: Number of siblings/spouses and parents/children aboard
Fare: Ticket price paid by the passenger
Embarked: Port of embarkation (C = Cherbourg, Q = Queenstown, S = Southampton)
Survived (Target Variable): 1 = Survived, 0 = Did not survive
Approach:
Data Preprocessing:

Handling missing values
Encoding categorical variables
Feature scaling and transformation
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Understanding survival distribution
Analyzing patterns based on age, class, and gender
Model Selection and Training:

Used multiple classification models such as Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Support Vector Machine
Evaluated performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
Results and Insights:

Identified key factors influencing survival probability
Compared model performances to select the best one
This project demonstrates practical machine learning applications using real-world data, focusing on data analysis, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.
